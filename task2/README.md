# Task 2

## Run

`python -m _main`

## ATTENTION!!!

- When reading features/labels from csv, sort the dataframe according to `PID`!!! Make sure the sequence of `PID` is consistent!!!

- For `np.nan` values in faetures, filled them as zero currently.

- Currently, use all features extracted. May decide which subsets to be used.
